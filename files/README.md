# DECO1400 Website Design Project: BENTO - Meal Planner  
### Done by: Lim Wanzhen (47305719)

Large parts of this website is hard-coded (unfortunately), but this documentation is so that you would know which parts are actually properly presented and coded (and assess me correctly!).

- **index.html**                -- Main homepage  
- **shoppingList.html**         -- Shopping List  
- **mealPLan.html**             -- Meal Plan
- **viewAllRecipes.html**       -- View All Recipes
- **manageRecipes.html**        -- Manage Recipes
- **bacon-carbonara.html**      -- (a working) Recipe Page
- **beef-lasagna.html**         -- (another working) Recipe Page

# Features
### 1. Mobile Compatibility
- iPad Air width: 820pixels
<img src="/files/MDsrc/iPadAir.png" width=820px>  

- for reference: wider screen resolutions like Surface Pro 7 (W: 912px), shows 5 recipes instead of 4

- try squeezing the screen to 500px or less!

### 2. my personal favourite: minimal borders
- (note: pikachu cursor not included)

### 3. Light and Night Mode
- (hooray for eye comforting visuals)

### 4. Print your shopping list! 
- What is the use of a meal planner website if you can't quickly get a shopping list to boot?

### 5. Breadcrumbs Bar
- Breadcrumbs shows where the userâ€™s location is on the website application. They can be used to trace the previous pages they have been to, to get to the current page they are on.
- Breadcrumbs are a good way for users to know how to go back to the previous page
- Navbar / Breadcrumb bar is consistent across all pages. Breadcrumb bar is repurposed to tell the current time on homepage. As a busy person, time is of the essence!

## Misc:
- Custom webkit scrollbar
- Box-shadows for the _aesthetic minimalist_ look
