# DECO1400 Website Design Project: BENTO - Meal Planner  
### Done by: Lim Wanzhen (47305719)

Large parts of this website is hard-coded (unfortunately), but this documentation is so that you would know which parts are actually properly presented and coded.

- **index.html**                -- Main homepage  
- **shoppingList.html**         -- Shopping List  
- **mealPLan.html**             -- Meal Plan
- **viewAllRecipes.html**       -- View All Recipes
- **manageRecipes.html**        -- Manage Recipes
- **bacon-carbonara.html**      -- (a working) Recipe Page
- **beef-lasagna.html**         -- (another working) Recipe Page

### Images

### Features
1. Mobile Compatibility
- iPad Air width: 820pixels
<img src="/files/MDsrc/iPadAir.png" width=820px>


- for reference: wider screen resolutions like Surface Pro 7 (W: 912px), shows 5 recipes instead of 4
<img src="/files/MDsrc/SurfacePro7.png" width=912px>


- try squeezing the screen to 500px or less!

2. my personal favourite: minimal borders
